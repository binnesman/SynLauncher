        <li>New client patch: v46</li>
        <li>Added a new menu for world map to help you find NPCs, objects, quests and items.</li>
        <li>Added option in Item Tracker to only show yellow ! in game world (or minimap) if the quest is currently listed in item tracker.</li>
        <li>Added filter options to professions based on attunement things.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where UnitClass("...") lua command sometimes returned wrong info if the target is something other than player.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Fixed bug where leaderboard failed to track dual class data between restarts. This will start to work on dungeon challenge times set from now on.</li>
        <li>Changed the way druid's Dreamwalk ability works and buffed it from 30% movement speed increase to 45%.</li>
        <li>Druid's Dreamwalk will now inherit all movement speed bonuses of your character.</li>
        <li>During Dreamwalk, damage taken by your main body does not carry over once the Dreamwalk ends, but if the body dies then Dreamwalk ends early.</li>
        <li>Dreamwalk can't be used while mounted, but can be used with travel form or flight form.</li>
        <li>Fixed small annoyance where if you one shoted an enemy then dungeon speed buff sometimes turned off for 1 frame and it caused weird movement.</li>
        <li>Killing XT-002 in Ulduar before the heart comes out should still count for dungeon challenge (but it is still not hard-mode loot).</li>
        <li>Vezax and Mimiron in Ulduar are now affected by dungeon event speedup.</li>
        <li>----------------</li>
        <li>Synastria Launcher: Added Pretty LootAlert Addon</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>21/08/2025</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>There is now dual class synergy for mage and warrior (check warrior perk sets on this class combo)</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where switching between prestiged and non-prestiged leaderboard of the same dungeon was causing issues.</li>
        <li>Priest Divine Purpose perk no longer requires Penance to be learned, and slightly redesigned how it works to make it better for both solo and group play.</li>
    </ul>
