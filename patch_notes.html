        <li>Changed how auto loot works, it now also immediately loots any killed enemies like Shadowstep Clone did previously with much greater range. This is in addition to normal auto loot where it works in a radius every X sec.</li>
        <li>Changed how attunes are stored on server side, if there are any new bugs related to attuned items please let me know immediately.</li>
        <li>There is now a separate leaderboard for prestiged dungeon challenges.</li>
        <li>Maybe fixed bug where Grievous Wounds sometimes does not apply Rend.</li>

        <li>Fixed bug where the honor kill calculation in AB did not reset between battles.</li>
