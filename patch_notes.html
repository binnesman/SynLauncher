    <ul>
        <li>Fixed bug where leaderboard failed to track dual class data between restarts. This will start to work on dungeon challenge times set from now on.</li>
        <li>Changed the way druid's Dreamwalk ability works and buffed it from 30% movement speed increase to 45%.</li>
        <li>Druid's Dreamwalk will now inherit all movement speed bonuses of your character.</li>
        <li>During Dreamwalk, damage taken by your main body does not carry over once the Dreamwalk ends, but if the body dies then Dreamwalk ends early.</li>
        <li>Dreamwalk can't be used while mounted, but can be used with travel form or flight form.</li>
        <li>Fixed small annoyance where if you one shoted an enemy then dungeon speed buff sometimes turned off for 1 frame and it caused weird movement.</li>
        <li>Killing XT-002 in Ulduar before the heart comes out should still count for dungeon challenge (but it is still not hard-mode loot).</li>
        <li>Vezax and Mimiron in Ulduar are now affected by dungeon event speedup.</li>
        <li>----------------</li>
        <li>Synastria Launcher: Added Pretty LootAlert Addon</li>

    <ul>
        <li>There is now dual class synergy for mage and warrior (check warrior perk sets on this class combo)</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where switching between prestiged and non-prestiged leaderboard of the same dungeon was causing issues.</li>
        <li>Priest Divine Purpose perk no longer requires Penance to be learned, and slightly redesigned how it works to make it better for both solo and group play.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Fix bug where Razorgore will reset fight if he uses Conflagrate and you are alone.</li>
        <li>Changed how auto loot works, it now also immediately loots any killed enemies like Shadowstep Clone did previously with much greater range. This is in addition to normal auto loot where it works in a radius every X sec.</li>
        <li>Changed how attunes are stored on server side, if there are any new bugs related to attuned items please let me know immediately.</li>
        <li>There is now a separate leaderboard for prestiged dungeon challenges.</li>
        <li>Maybe fixed bug where Grievous Wounds sometimes does not apply Rend.</li>
        <li>Maybe fixed bug where Executor execute radius was too strict.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where the honor kill calculation in AB did not reset between battles.</li>
        <li>Enhance shaman perk set (4) bonus now also reduces internal cooldown of windfury attacks. Also windfury weapon on off-hand weapon has its own internal cooldown separate from main hand.</li>
        <li>Added another arena conversion token for 10x amount for 10x cost.</li>
    </ul>
