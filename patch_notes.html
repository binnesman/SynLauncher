        <li>Note from Binnes: Check out these new addons by Netrinil recently added to the launcher:</li>
        <li>Questie: Modified Questie to properly track current world event, better querying for actual completed quests even from before installing the addon, and you can track perk unlock/upgrade requirements progress in your quest tracker.</li>
        <li>TradeSkillInfo: Modified to show how many resources (ores, bars, gems, etc) are required to craft all remaining attunable items on your character or account (configurable).</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Fix bug where Purifying Light perk made the holy paladin (2) perk set bonus not work.</li>
        <li>Maybe fixed bug where Shaman wave jump was sometimes affected by cooldowns of other spells when in dual class.</li>
        <li>Counterattack! quest in barrens is now auto completed.</li>
        <li>Added some code to try make Nagrand arena NPC fix itself over time if something goes wrong.</li>
        <li>Leave No One Behind in Zul'drak auto completes.</li>
        <li>Nightmare Manifests (eranikus) in Moonglade auto completes.</li>
        <li>Warrior can hide the red effect of fury perk set (in Balance: Warrior perk).</li>
        <li>Changed all unlock tasks that require a level 77+ enemy to require a (your level - 3) instead.</li>
        <li>All 60% land mounts will use 100% speed instead, and all 150% fly mounts will use 280% (or 310% if you have acquired any) speed.</li>
        <li>The Sunwell Plateau crafted items that require a specific class to see recipe on, now also have that class requirement on the item itself. This makes them not attunable on other classes and get into a weird situation where you have the recipe, but don't see it.</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>29/10/2025</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Buffed holy paladin's Prismatic Light perk from 30% reduction to 0% at maximum rank.</li>
        <li>Replaced holy paladin's Improved Divine Favor perk with a new one that lets the set become more damage focused.</li>
        <li>Buffed the holy paladin's (2) set bonus cooldown reduction from 1 second to 1.5 seconds.</li>
        <li>Paladin Tier 3 bonus that boosts holy ray is removed.</li>
        <li>Changed all perks that do something within melee range to instead have 8 yard radius range. This is mostly some warrior perks.</li>
        <li>Maybe fixed bug where ice wall in SWP was not removed sometimes when too high speed buff.</li>
        <li>The delay after a boss in Black Morass is now slightly less, hopefully to make 50 speed buff possible.</li>
        <li>Nightbane in Karazhan can now be one shotted, if the first damage you deal is greater than its maximum health.</li>
        <li>Gargoyles and Frost Wyrms no longer spawn in Hyjal, but all damage and health of enemies is increased by 50%. Speedbuff thresholds have been adjusted slightly for this raid</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where some custom spell effects (for example Soulstorm) could end early if enemy reflected damage.</li>
        <li>Part2:</li>
        <li>Rip & Tear druid perk now also has a range of at least 8 yards (from previous patch).</li>
        <li>Adjusted Hyjal speedbuff thresholds again a bit.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where the new holy paladin perk from last update did not work.</li>
    </ul>
