    <ul>
        <li>New client patch: v45</li>
        <li>There is now a new thing where some dual class combinations will have special synergy added. Currently the only one that has this is Paladin and Priest combo (Martyr). You can read about the special effects on the paladin perk set bonuses if you have this class combination.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where .coerceitem was implemented wrong and worked on some things it wasn't supposed to.</li>
        <li>Slightly adjusted holy paladin ray cooldown reduction logic, so it should work more consistently.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where some dual class combinations could have more than 10 different shapeshift things, which caused the client to have lua errors.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
