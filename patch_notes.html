        <li>Maybe fixed bug where Rend applied by Bladestorm did less damage than it was supposed to.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where auto shapeshift could still shapeshift into a previous form if you reset talents and lost the spell.</li>
        <li>Druid Celestial Wrath perk (Starfall periodic) can now attack enemies who are not in combat with you, and has an option to disable it.</li>
        <li>Changed the way Juggernaut works (warrior utility move perk). The cooldown now starts only after it expires, but is reduced from 20 seconds to 10 seconds. While Juggernaut is active, enemies will not aggro you.</li>
        <li>Tried to fix some bugs related to quest sometimes not completing when killing with pets.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Auto mount and auto shapeshift no longer cause a GCD, because it didn't show up on client side and then caused some abilities to not be usable without clear indication for player as to why.</li>
        <li>Fixed some issues where auto mount and auto shapeshift would fight with each other a little bit.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where Mirror Images sometimes wouldn't get out of combat after combat ends.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where Mirror Images would sometimes start the fight with low damage regular Mirror Image frostbolt spell.</li>
    </ul>
