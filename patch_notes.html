        <li>Auto mount and auto shapeshift no longer cause a GCD, because it didn't show up on client side and then caused some abilities to not be usable without clear indication for player as to why.</li>
        <li>Fixed some issues where auto mount and auto shapeshift would fight with each other a little bit.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where Mirror Images sometimes wouldn't get out of combat after combat ends.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where Mirror Images would sometimes start the fight with low damage regular Mirror Image frostbolt spell.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Added a misc perk to druids for auto shapeshift into last non-travel form.</li>
        <li>Mirror Images will now heal to full when out of combat. This was something you could do yourself anyway by toggling Mirror Image twice so this is mostly a QoL thing.</li>
        <li>Added option to disable Polymorph spell from Mirror Images (it's in Hivemind perk but is applied even if you didn't take this perk).</li>
        <li>Buffed Shadow Priest perk set bonus (4) from 50% to 75%.</li>
        <li>Ghok Bashguud should now always spawn.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where Mana Battery perk option for not consuming Arcane Potency was not working.</li>
        <li>Maybe fixed bug where the split damage from Shattered Lens (mirror image perk set) was causing weird effects such as delaying your spells.</li>
        <li>Spell penetration is no longer applied to self damage.</li>
        <li>Maybe fixed bug where sometimes damage from custom pets didn't apply your spell penetration.</li>
        <li>Made racial leaders respawn faster.</li>
        <li>Added Demon Armor to warlock's auto buff.</li>
    </ul>
