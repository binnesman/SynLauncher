    <ul>
        <li>Fix bug where Purifying Light perk made the holy paladin (2) perk set bonus not work.</li>
        <li>Maybe fixed bug where Shaman wave jump was sometimes affected by cooldowns of other spells when in dual class.</li>
        <li>Counterattack! quest in barrens is now auto completed.</li>
        <li>Added some code to try make Nagrand arena NPC fix itself over time if something goes wrong.</li>
        <li>Leave No One Behind in Zul'drak auto completes.</li>
        <li>Nightmare Manifests (eranikus) in Moonglade auto completes.</li>
        <li>Warrior can hide the red effect of fury perk set (in Balance: Warrior perk).</li>
        <li>Changed all unlock tasks that require a level 77+ enemy to require a (your level - 3) instead.</li>
        <li>All 60% land mounts will use 100% speed instead, and all 150% fly mounts will use 280% (or 310% if you have acquired any) speed.</li>
        <li>The Sunwell Plateau crafted items that require a specific class to see recipe on, now also have that class requirement on the item itself. This makes them not attunable on other classes and get into a weird situation where you have the recipe, but don't see it.</li>
