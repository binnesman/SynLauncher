    <ul>
        <li>New client patch: v45</li>
        <li>There is now a new thing where some dual class combinations will have special synergy added. Currently the only one that has this is Paladin and Priest combo (Martyr). You can read about the special effects on the paladin perk set bonuses if you have this class combination.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where .coerceitem was implemented wrong and worked on some things it wasn't supposed to.</li>
        <li>Slightly adjusted holy paladin ray cooldown reduction logic, so it should work more consistently.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where some dual class combinations could have more than 10 different shapeshift things, which caused the client to have lua errors.</li>
    </ul>
</li>

    <strong>07/08/2025</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed typo where battleground was dropping too many Pvp tokens.</li>
        <li>There is a new command .coerceitem to let prestiged players overwrite the loot coercion for a specific item.</li>
        <li>Removed honorable defender honor buff in Arathi Basin.</li>
        <li>Winning in Arathi Basin gives slightly more honor.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where if battleground bot died and got sent to a graveyard, and then that point was captured by other faction, then the bot could still resurrect in that graveyard.</li>
        <li>Changed a bit how honor is calculated in bot battleground, to hopefully avoid a situation where it's best to stay in one place and camp enemies.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
