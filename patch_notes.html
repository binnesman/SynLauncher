        <li>Shaman Spirit Wolves no longer heal if taking the Enhanced Spirits perk.</li>
        <li>Buffed Enhance Shaman (5) set bonus from 0.5x to 0.7x.</li>
        <li>Fire mage Spreading Flames perk will now also proc and spread Ignite if the original damage killed the enemy, and the bonus damage from the perk is also transfered along with Ignite.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where Ignite and some other effects caused their damage immediately on the first tick.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Redesigned Enhance Shaman perk set. This may still be adjusted for balance in the following weeks.</li>
        <li>Maybe fixed bug where if Living Bomb had both Short Fuse and the druid periodic effect perk then it became infinite duration and never did any damage.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Maybe fixed bug where Rend applied by Bladestorm did less damage than it was supposed to.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where auto shapeshift could still shapeshift into a previous form if you reset talents and lost the spell.</li>
        <li>Druid Celestial Wrath perk (Starfall periodic) can now attack enemies who are not in combat with you, and has an option to disable it.</li>
        <li>Changed the way Juggernaut works (warrior utility move perk). The cooldown now starts only after it expires, but is reduced from 20 seconds to 10 seconds. While Juggernaut is active, enemies will not aggro you.</li>
        <li>Tried to fix some bugs related to quest sometimes not completing when killing with pets.</li>
    </ul>
